    <p>The goal of this project will be to show trends of mobile processors, growth of companies behind them, sales of models and how mobile processors are overall more efficient in power and costs and show why they will lead in the tech market. I will also be comparing them to desktop processors.</p>
    <p>Alpha Release:</p>
    <p>Overview: At this stage, I am working on collecting data of popular processors on the market. This includes desktop and mobile chips, specially: their prices, costs, and benchmark scores. And creating graphs that'll compare them.</p>
    <p>Features: Most of the important bar charts have been created</p>
    <p>Upcoming immediate milestones: My data goal is almost complete and most of my still graphs are done</p>
    <p>Roadblocks: I still need to work on my interactive graphs on D3. </p>
